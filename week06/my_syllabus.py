"""Week 6 · Part 5: ask my syllabus (the chapter's Exercise 5).

Reads my_syllabus.txt (the course website comes with the lab; paste in your
own document if you like), chunks it, and answers each question using ONLY
what it retrieves, with citations. Replace the questions with five you care
about, including one whose answer isn't in the document.
